**pomerol** is an exact diagonalization (full ED) code written in C++ aimed at
solving condensed matter second-quantized models of interacting fermions
and bosons on finite size lattices at finite temperatures.
It is designed to compute thermal expectation values of observables, single- and
two-particle Green's functions as well as susceptibilities.

##  Features

  * High performance exact calculation of Green's functions, two-particle
    Green's functions and susceptibilities in Matsubara domain.
  * Many-body Hamiltonians can be specified in a natural mathematical form using
    [libcommute's](https://krivenko.github.io/libcommute/) Domain-Specific
    Language. Hamiltonian presets for commonly used lattice models are also
    available.
  * Automatic symmetry analysis of the many-body Hamiltonians drastically
    reduces computational costs.
  * [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) template library is used for numerical
    linear algebra.
  * [MPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) +
    [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) support.

## Installation
### From source

  - Check the *dependencies*:

    * A C++11 conformant compiler
    * CMake >= 3.11.0
    * Boost >= 1.54.0 (only headers are required)
    * Eigen >= 3.1.0
    * [libcommute >= 0.7.2](https://github.com/krivenko/libcommute)
    * An MPI 3.0 implementation
    * Git to fetch the sources

  - Download the latest sources:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pomerol-ed/pomerol.git
    ```

  - Create a (temporary) build directory and change to it:

    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```

  - In this build directory, run

    ```
    cmake <path_to_pomerol_sources> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path>
    ```
    * If CMake configuration file of libcommute cannot be found, add
      `-Dlibcommute_DIR=<libcommute_installation_path>/lib/cmake/libcommute` to the command line.
    * Add `-DTesting=OFF` to disable compilation of unit tests (not recommended).
    * Add `-DProgs=ON` to compile provided executables (from `progs`
      directory). Some of the executables depend on the
      [gftools](https://github.com/pomerol-ed/gftools) library, which will be
      automatically downloaded in case it cannot be found by CMake (use
      `-Dgftools_DIR` to specify its installation path). gftools supports saving
      to HDF5 through [ALPSCore](http://alpscore.org).
    * Add `-DDocumentation=OFF` to disable generation of reference
      documentation.
    * Add `-DUSE_OPENMP=OFF` to disable OpenMP optimization for two-particle GF
      calculation.
    * Add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` to compile static instead of shared libraries.
  - `make`
  - `make test` (if unit tests are compiled)
  - `make install`
  - `make doc` generates the Doxygen reference documentation in the `doc/html`
    subdirectory.

The library, _libpomerol_ is built. It can be used for linking with executables.
Some working executables are given in `prog` subdirectory.

> :warning: It has been [reported](https://github.com/pomerol-ed/pomerol/pull/60)
that some [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/)-based MPI implementations, such as HPE
Cray MPI may not properly support `MPI_CXX_*` datatypes, which pomerol's code
depends on. In case you see failing MPI unit tests when linking to said MPI
libraries, try using CMake option `-DUse_MPI_C_datatypes=ON`.

## Interfacing with your own code and other libraries

Check the `tutorial` directory for an example of a pomerol-based code that is
linked to external libraries.

The interface to [TRIQS library](https://triqs.github.io/triqs/latest/) is
readily available: <https://github.com/krivenko/pomerol2triqs>.
